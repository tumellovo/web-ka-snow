# Web ka S'now ☃️

Welcome to **Web ka S'now** – a lighthearted learning log and HTML starter project!

This repository captures my early steps into the world of web development. Think of it as my coursework playground – a personal reflection of what I’ve learned while following along with my educator’s HTML lessons.

## 🌐 What's Inside

Here’s a sneak peek into what this repo contains:

- `index.html` – The homepage and starting point.
- `about.html`, `boat.html`, `links.html`, `lists.html` – Basic practice pages exploring different HTML elements.
- `style.css` – A simple CSS file to spice up the visuals.

Each file is a hands-on response to specific exercises and topics covered in an introductory HTML course.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project is:
- A personal record of my web development progress
- A collection of completed coursework-style exercises
- A place where I can reflect, review, and improve

If you’re a beginner too, feel free to peek inside and see how I’m figuring it all out!

## 📌 Notes
