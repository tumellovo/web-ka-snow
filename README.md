# Web ka S'now ☃️

Welcome to **Web ka S'now** – a lighthearted learning log and HTML starter project!

This repository captures my early steps into the world of web development. Think of it as my coursework playground – a personal reflection of what I’ve learned while following along with my educator’s HTML lessons.

##  What's Inside

Here’s a sneak peek into what this repo contains:

- `index.html` – The homepage and starting point.
- `about.html`, `boat.html`, `links.html`, `lists.html` – Basic practice pages exploring different HTML elements.
- `style.css` – A simple CSS file to spice up the visuals.

Each file is a hands-on response to specific exercises and topics covered in an introductory HTML course.

##  Purpose

This project is:
- A personal record of my web development progress
- A collection of completed coursework-style exercises
- A place where I can reflect, review, and improve

If you’re a beginner too, feel free to peek inside and see how I’m figuring it all out!

##  What You'll See

-  Proper HTML structure
-  Headings, paragraphs, and links
-  Lists (both fancy and plain!)
-  Images and styling with CSS

---

##  How to View

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open any of the `.html` files in your browser.
3. Check out the styling in `style.css` and the images in the `/images/` folder.

##  Notes

- This isn’t a polished final project—it’s more like a creative learning sandbox.
- I plan to upload more “modules” as I move forward through the course.
